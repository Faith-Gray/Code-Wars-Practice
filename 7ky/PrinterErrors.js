// In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

// The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

// Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

// You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

// The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
// Examples:

// s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
// printer_error(s) => "0/14"

// s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
// printer_error(s) => "8/22"

function printerError(s) {

    const dic = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm'];
    const splitString = s.split('');
    let error = 0;
    splitString.map((x) => dic.includes(x) === false ? error += 1 : error += 0);
    
   return `${error}/${s.length}`;

}

//I love this problem and this solution because it allowed for me to get a better understanding of the map method. I took a look at the other answers on Codewars and I think this one is the most intuitive. My first thought was to loop through the array and check every single one for if it matched each individual character. While that would have worked. It obviously would have ended up super long.
